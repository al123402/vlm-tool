.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Reads the named
\fI/var/log/messages\fR
files, sorts them by the timestamp, and then filters the result.
Recognizes and automatically expands \fB.bz2\fR and \fB.gz\fR compressed files.
If no files are named, then the local
\fI/var/log/messages\fR*
files are read by default.
This will require superuser privilege, so don't be surprised.
.PP
Program output is written to stdout by default; change this using the \fI-o\fR option.
.PP
With no selection options, \fIvlm-tool\fR will compare each message file entry
against a built-in list of trigger words, which are really just python regular expressions.
Additional trigger words can be added using the \fI-a\fR option.
Triggers can be bulk loaded from a file, one per line, using the \fI-b\fR option.
.PP
All matching is case insensitive.
.PP
Avoid loading the built-in triggers by using the \fI-n\fR option.
.PP
Lines containing one or more trigger word may be \fImarked\fR.
When output, the line will be prefixed by the \fIthumb\fR, which is an asterisk (*) by default.
Use the \fI-r\fR option to identify which trigger was matched against the line.
.PP
The output may be colorized by using the \fI-c\fR option.
Non-matched parts of the line are written normally;
the matching segment is highlighted using a bright red color.
ANSI color escapes are used for this.
Currently, the colors may not be changed.
As an aide to visually grouping related entries together, host names are
highlighted using separate colors.
Host name colors are recycled as needed.
.SH POSTPROCESSING
.PP
When any of the marking options (\fI-c\fR or \fI-m\fR) are used, all of the
input lines are kept.
A special post-processing phase is then enabled.
\fIVLM-TOOL\fR attempts to highlight interesting stanzas of lines.
What stanzas the tool considers to be interesting cannot be changed from the
command line.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-a re" 10m
Append the python regular expression \fBre\fR to the list of triggers.
.IP "-b FILE" 10m
Bulk-load a list of python regular expressions from \fBFILE\fR, one per line.
.IP "-c" 10m
Colorize the matching text in each entry, using ANSI escape codes.
.IP "-m" 10m
Mark those lines matching one or more triggers by prepending the \fBTHUMB\fR
to the output line.
An appropriate number of spaces are used for non-matching entries.
.IP "-n" 10m
Do not populate the built-in triggers before processing the command line
or reading a bulk file.
.IP "-o FILE" 10m
Write output to \fBFILE\fR instead of to the standard output.
.IP "-r" 10m
Show the matching trigger rule which caused the entry to be marked.
.IP "-s" 10m
Output some statistics.
Not really useful to anybody except the author and probably not even him.

.SH BUGS
.PP
All of the \fI/var/log/messages\fR files must be from the same year.
The tool does not handle lines from differing years very well.
If could probably be modified to treat a timestamp of later in the year than
the current time as being from the prior year, but this complicates things and
slows things down as well.
Since we typically receive 100,000 line logs, speed matters.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "\f(CR$ sudo vlm-tool\fP." 20m
Output only those lines in \fI/var/log/messages*\fP which match one or
more trigger patterns.
.IP "\f(CR$ vlm-tool -a foo messages\fP" 20m
Output only entries matching the built-in patterns and \fIfoo\fP.
.IP "\f(CR$ vlm-tool -o results messages\fP" 20m
Write matching lines into \fBresults\fP instead of to the standard output.
.IP "\f(CR$ sudo vlm-tool -m\fP" 20m
Ingest all the entries in the \fI/var/log/messages*\fP files.
Output all lines, marking lines matching one or more triggers using the
\fITHUMB\fP.
Performs the postprocessing phase to highlight interesting stanzas.
The default \fITHUMB\fP is an asterisk (*).
.IP "\f(CR$ vlm-tool -mr -o myfile foo foo.1.gz\fP" 20m
Ingest all entries in \fIfoo\fP and \fIfoo.1.gz\fP and sort by timestamp.
Prefix any line matching one or more triggers with the \fITHUMB\fP and the
text of the matching rule.
Performs the postprocessing phase to highlight interesting stanzas.
.IP "\f(CR$ vlm-tool -c messages | less\fP" 20m
Ingest all entries from \fBmessages\fP and output all lines,
highlighting lines with one or more matches.
Performs the postprocessing phase to highlight interesting stanzas.
.IP "\f(CR$ vlm-tool -n -a ocfs2 messages\fP" 20m
Output only those entries matching the trigger of \fIocfs2\fP.
Note the use of the \fI-n\fP option to disable loading of the built-in rules.
